	五十九、不要志气高大，倒要俯就卑微的人。不要自以为聪明。
人生是一个长久的路径，理想是最优美的理想，一部分不妨艰难，低微，以至得过且过，然而不许没有理想。只有心中存有理想，就有变换人生的自大和时机。连接的去追赶，百折不挠的去全力，对将来充溢无比的期盼，纵然不许青云直上，也不至于白手而归。山峦震动，清流曲折，咱们不免会感触迷惑，以至人生的路途会歪斜，然而咱们也会有理想，有自大的步调和点点滴滴的生长体验，把那些一点一点凝固起来，即是咱们所穿梭的人生之路了。

Fifty-nine, not high things, but condescend to men of low estate.
Do not think himself so.
Life is a long path, ideal is the most beautiful ideal, try hard, humble, down to muddle along, however, are not allowed to have no ideal.
Life only had the ideal, there is a transformation of arrogance and timing.
Connection to catch, persistent efforts to, filled with great anticipation for the future, even if not, also not be nothing.
Mountains shake, clean twists and turns, we inevitably feel confused, so that the journey of life will be skewed, but let's also have ideal, have a great pace and the growth experience of dribs and drabs, who set up bit by bit, is that we travel the road of life.
